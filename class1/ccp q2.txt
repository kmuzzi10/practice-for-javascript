The best scheduling algorithm for both the teams in this case would be the Round Robin scheduling algorithm.

Round Robin scheduling algorithm is a preemptive algorithm which assigns CPU time to each process in a circular order. It is the most widely used algorithm as it allows process of equal priority to have equal CPU time. In this competition, the chefs of both team X and Y can have equal access to the oven.

Decision Mode: In Round Robin scheduling algorithm, decision making is based on time slices. This means that the chefs can be assigned to the oven in a round-robin fashion, with each chef getting a fixed time slice to cook their dish. 

Throughput: The throughput of the Round Robin scheduling algorithm is high and all the chefs will get a chance to cook their dish within the allocated time.

Response Time: The response time of the Round Robin scheduling algorithm is low as the chefs will not have to wait for long before they get access to the oven.

Effect On Process: The Round Robin scheduling algorithm is a preemptive algorithm, so a chef may have to stop cooking their dish and wait for their turn if another chefâ€™s time slice is over.
